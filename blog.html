          Stepping into NCST for the first time was both exciting and a little nerve-wracking. Just a year ago, I was still in Mapúa, pursuing Computer Engineering. I loved tinkering with hardware and circuits, but as I delved deeper, I realized that my true passion lay in software and artificial intelligence—fields I believe are the future of technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          The decision to transfer wasn’t easy. I weighed my options late into nights, asking myself: “Am I ready to leave everything I know?” But the moment I set foot on the NCST campus and met the faculty and students in the IT department, I knew I’d made the right choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the best parts of joining NCST has been the friends I’ve made. In our IT classes, I found people who share my curiosity for building impactful platforms—whether it’s a crisp, user-friendly app or an AI agent that can help solve real-world problems. Even though most of them are now heading into their third year, they welcomed me into study groups, hackathons, and late-night brainstorming sessions without hesitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through projects and group work, I’ve learned so much: how to architect a database schema, the fundamentals of clean code, and the basics of machine learning models. Beyond the technical skills, NCST has taught me resilience, teamwork, and the importance of community—values I’ll carry into every future venture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking ahead, my aspiration is clear: one day I want to build an impactful tech platform that addresses real needs—be it in education, healthcare, or community building. It won’t happen overnight, but my first year at NCST has laid the foundation. I’m grateful for every mentor, classmate, and challenge that’s shaped my journey so far.
